## How to run
If you want to run everything, just run the notebook.

After running everything, if you want to see an algorithm being run, you can just run the corresponding cell.

However, if you don't want to run everything and just a specific cell, bear in mind you should be mindful of the functions and variables the cell requires and run those before as well.
